# Introduction
jqui is a OS X user interface for the [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) JSON query tool.   It provides a query box, JSON input box, and then the output of the query.  

# Development
In order to develop jqui, you'll need XCode 6.4 installed.  The application runs a local version of jq so having jq installed is not necessary.
