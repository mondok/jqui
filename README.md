# Introduction
jqui is a OS X user interface for the [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) JSON query tool.   It provides a query box, JSON input box, and then the output of the query.  

# Development
In order to develop jqui, you'll need XCode 6.4 installed.  The application runs a local version of jq so having jq installed is not necessary.

# Download and Installation
A pre-built jqui can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/mondok/jqui/blob/master/distribution/jqui.zip).  Simply unzip the application and run it.  Keep in mind that Gatekeeper will need an exception for this app, or you will need to enable "Allow apps to be downloaded from Anywhere."
